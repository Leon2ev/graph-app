      <h1>Graph or not to graph</h1>
      <p>
        Application to check if a graph is red-blue colorable. A graph is 
        red-blue colorable if two connected nodes have never the same color 
        and the graph is a connected graph. A user should be able to enter 
        a graph in a text area by typing some paths (a word is a node, a 
        dash an edge and a new line or a comma a separation between paths).
      </p>
      <h4>Some examples:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Input: a - b - c
        </li>
        <li>
          Output: Is a connected and red-blue colorable graph
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          Input: a - b, f - g
        </li>
        <li>
          Output: Is not a connected graph
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          Input: a - b - c - a
        </li>
        <li>
          Output: Is a connected graph, but not red blue colorable
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          Input: a - b, c - d, b - c, a - d
        </li>
        <li>
          Output: Is a connected and red-blue colorable graph
        </li>

        Connected graph (from Wikipedia,

        A graph is said to be connected if every pair of vertices in the graph is connected. 
        This means that there is a path between every pair of vertices. An undirected graph that is 
        not connected is called disconnected. An undirected graph G is therefore disconnected if 
        there exist two vertices in G such that no path in G has these vertices as endpoints. A 
        graph with just one vertex is connected. An edgeless graph with two or more vertices is 
        disconnected.
